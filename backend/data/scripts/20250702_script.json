  "script": "Hey cricket fans, ever wonder what wild history July 2nd holds in the cricketing world? Trust me, it's packed with some unforgettable moments!\n\nLet's rewind to 1969. Imagine this: a relatively unknown Ireland team bowling out the mighty West Indies, for a jaw-dropping 25 runs! Yes, you heard that right, twenty-five! This wasn't just an upset; it was an earthquake in cricketing circles. Dougie Goodwin and Alec O'Riordan were the heroes, tearing through one of the most formidable batting lineups. It just proves, in cricket, anything can happen!\n\nFast forward to a more recent shocker, July 2nd, 2022. Stuart Broad, one of England's legendary bowlers, found himself on the wrong end of history. During a Test match against India, he conceded a staggering 35 runs in a single over, the most expensive in Test history! And guess who was doing the damage? None other than Jasprit Bumrah, India's fast bowler, smashing 29 of those runs himself! It was absolute carnage, a moment that left everyone speechless.\n\nNow, let's go way back to 1935, a truly historic day for South African cricket. On July 2nd, they secured their first-ever Test match victory on English soil, defeating England by 157 runs at the iconic Lord's! This wasn't just a win; it was a statement, marking South Africa's emergence as a formidable force in Test cricket on the global stage.\n\nTalk about a day for the record books, right? Which of these incredible moments do you remember most? Or which one blows your mind?"
