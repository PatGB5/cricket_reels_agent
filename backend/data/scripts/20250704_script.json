A true legend who paved the way for many.\n\nThen, talk about an all-round masterclass! On July 4, 1984, West Indian great Alvin Kallicharran unleashed an unbelievable performance. Playing for Warwickshire, he not only smashed 206 runs but also grabbed 6 wickets in the same NatWest Trophy match against Oxfordshire! That's a rare double-punch of pure dominance!\n\nAnd finally, the Master Blaster himself. On July 4, 2001, Sachin Tendulkar showed why he's a legend. He scored an unbeaten 122 against West Indies in the Coca-Cola Cup in Harare, guiding India to a six-wicket victory. Classic Sachin, leading from the front!\n\nWhich of these legendary moments do you remember most?"
